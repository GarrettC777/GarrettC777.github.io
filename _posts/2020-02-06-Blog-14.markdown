The Raspberry Pi has so many different uses, when I bought a Raspberry Pi 3, the first project I wanted to try was the PiHole.  The PiHole is a network wide DNS level add blocker for your personal network needs.  The best part is, it's free!  It's pretty simple to get started as long as you remember to do a few things once the PiHole is installed so let's get into it.  

The first thing you're going to want to do is figure out what operating system you're going to be running the software on, and you can find a list of supported operating systems on the PiHole website [here](https://docs.pi-hole.net/main/prerequesites/#supported-operating-systems).
