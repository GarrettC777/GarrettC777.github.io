Ubuntu is a widely supported open source debian/linux opperating system that has come a long way and continues
to be introduced to many with a continuing growing support.  That being said, it still finds trouble with compatibility,
especially on laptops that were never intended to use the operating system.  Never the less, this article will show you
that should you want to install Ubuntu on your Microsoft Surfact Laptop, you do have the power to do so.

As for a short explanation to this idea, a friend of mine recently had Microsoft tell him that his laptop contained a bad
ssd after it would not boot.  He wasn't going to get it replaced, so I thought I might try to do what I can.  If your 
Microsoft Surface Laptop SSD is pronounced dead, you may want to try this, though Mileage may vary.  Here begins the endevor.

First things first, I flashed a Ubuntu 18.04 Bionic image to a USB.  Next,  I booted the laptop and because the SSD was not being
read correctly, it booted straight to the UEFI (otherwise click the F6 key a few times while powering on).
