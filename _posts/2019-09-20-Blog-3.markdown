This week I got my hands on Ansible Automation first hand creating a couple of playbooks and deploying them inside containers
on my localhost.  Ansible is pretty simple to get started with as it has amazing documentation on their website.  Despite this, I did
run into a few roadblocks a long the way with inputing text into an existing file using ansible.  This post really isn't just to share with
you my struggles and to further strengthen my knowledge with this tool, but also to help anyone who's having struggles with the Ansible module *lineinfile*.
So let's get right to it.

The module that carries out the task of copying, modifying, or removing text in a file is the *lineinfile* module.  There are a few important paramters
in particular that are very simple to get started with and can be uses to do the job, such as *insertafter*, *line*, *mode*, *regexp*.  Here is an example we can break down
to show how the *lineinfile* module can carry out it's modifications to a file using the a YML playbook file.

```
	- name: give cit480 group sudo access to run traceroute command
	  lineinfile:
	     dest: /etc/sudoers
		 insertafter: '^%admins'
		 line: '%admins ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/sbin/traceroute'
		 validate: /usr/sbin/visudo -cf %s
```
