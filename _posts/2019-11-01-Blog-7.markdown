Terraform has many resources that the user can access to create the enviornments, users, and other configurations all from the aws-cli.  One of the very important resources is the aws_iam_group_policy, for with this, a policy can be attached to iam users through the group they belong to.  I found myself creating a very simple group policy for a project in my senior design class.  In this article, I'd like to break down some of the different parts of the group policy itself, as it can be a little confusing at first glance.  Here is an excerpt from my terraform code that shows the entire group policy I've created.
```
 policy = <<POLICY
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "Stmt1572583073912",
      "Action": "*",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Resource": "*",
      "Condition": {
        "StringEquals": {
          "aws:RequestedRegion": "us-west-2"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
POLICY
}
```
