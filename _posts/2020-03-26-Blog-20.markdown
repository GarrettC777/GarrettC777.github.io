&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lately I've had quite a bit of time on my hands so I decided to harden my home servers for a bit of fun.  Luckily both my servers are running on 
operating systems that already have iptables installed as their firewall systems, but with their distrobutions, they come with blank rule slates.  All traffic is allowed by default.
In this tutorial I'm going to give you the basics on how to create a simple set of firewall rules that will go a long way in protecting your ports from unwanted traffic.  So let's get right into it.

### Installing iptables

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you don't have iptables installed already, you should install it now using the package manager of your distrobution.  In my case, I'm going to use The Advanced Package Tool based on personal choice.  If your OS is debian based like Ubuntu, you can use the command below.
```
sudo apt-get install iptables
```
Once you've installed the iptables firewall, you can now look at your iptables list of rules, which should be blank.  You can do so with the iptables command with the flag "-L".
```
iptables -L
```
It should give you an output like this:
```
Output:
Chain INPUT (policy ACCEPT)
target     prot opt source               destination         

Chain FORWARD (policy ACCEPT)
target     prot opt source               destination         

Chain OUTPUT (policy ACCEPT)
target     prot opt source               destination
```
If you do already have rules, you can flush them by issuing the flush flag: **iptables -F**.
