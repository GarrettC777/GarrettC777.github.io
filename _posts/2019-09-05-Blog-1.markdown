For the sake of getting into the technical aspects of this docker setup, I'll be short with the description.  Docker is a tool that allows you to create and run applications using containers.
Containers are much more lightweight than using a full virtual machine to run the entire operating system, because instead of the entire operating system being installed, containers just
use the binaries related to running the instance of your application to create a more lightweight and scallable version of your application.
