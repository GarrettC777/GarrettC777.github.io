 Docker is a tool that allows you to create and run applications using containers. Containers are much more lightweight than using a 
full virtual machine to run the entire operating system, because instead of the entire operating system being installed for your application to run, 
containers just use the binaries related to running the instance of your application to create a more lightweight 
and scallable version of your application.  Now that we've covered the basics, I'll start off by saying that I have very little prior experience with Docker.

Aside from watching Redhat's Kubernetes and Docker tonline tutorials and seeing docker seminars at a few conventions, I haven't really gotten my hands
on it until this lab.  Granted this lab is for first year cit160 students and CSUN and we were supposed to test out the feasability of it, I still knew I'd come out
of this learning a great deal of the basics knowing I hadn't worked with docker before.
