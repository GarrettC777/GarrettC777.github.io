On servers and even everyday work station computers, there are times when you need to securely copy over files
to a desired host.  That's where SCP comes in, and it stands for Secure Copy.  It is a encrypted end-to-end
transfer of files.  So let's break down a simple scp example usage.
```
scp -P 777 /home/stacy/images/image*.jpg stacy@myhost.com:/home/stacy/archive 
```
- **scp**:
- **-P 777**:
- **/home/stacy/images/image*.jpg**
- **stacy@myhost.com:/home/stacy/archive**
