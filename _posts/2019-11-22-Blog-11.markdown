Within the linux operating system and other unix-based operating systems, the grep command processes text line for line
and prints the lines which related to the pattern specified.  The syntax goes as follows:
```
grep [OPTION]... PATTERN [FILE]...
```
For example, in the log file (*auth.log*)  below, a list of attempts from a user trying to get into an account are shown.
Let's say he got in, and I'd like to know when he got in.  I could invoke the grep command and find out.
```

```
The full command to be used:
```
grep -n -i "Accepted" auth.log
```
**Command Breakdown**
- **grep**: The base command that performs the lookup.
- **-n**: This flag will show the line number of the successful matches.
- **-i**: This ignores the case and looks for any case of the word "Accepted".
- **auth.log**: This is the file to look inside of and grab the lines out of.

So the output we will see will look something like this:
```
15: Oct 11 10:36:59 myraptor sshd[30003]: Accepted password for harvey from 30.167.206.91 port 55326 ssh2
```

There are many other options for finding text that you can look at regarding special cases and if needed, typing
"grep --help" on the command line would be a good start.  For such a simple command, it can prove
to be very powerful.
